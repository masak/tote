TOTE -- An addictively helpful TDD harness for Perl 6

Nothing to see here, yet. I'm just releasing early. The idea for this
piece of software is outlined over here:
<http://use.perl.org/~masak/journal/39639>

Next steps:

* Make a simple script that recognizes when any of a given set of files
  is saved

* Make it run 'make'

* If 'make' succeeds, make it run 'make test'

* Introduce smart analysis of the test results: recognize regressions,
  no change compared to the last checkpoint, or an improvement.

* Make it react right to these three outcomes: go back to dev mode
  on regressions or no change, go to checkpoint on improvements.

* Introduce automatic commits.

* Make the test mode work as intended.

Oh, and the nice graph diagram/tote-workflow.png was generated by
DiTAA <http://ditaa.sourceforge.net> from diagram/tote-workflow.
You should try DiTAA, it's pretty neat.
